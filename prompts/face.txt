Follow these rules:
Please generate a random cute ASCII art face and return only the plaintext of the face, and nothing else. 
To do this, please use any means necessary such as Python code, command line utilities, or any other methods available to you. 
Please make sure that the output consists only of the plaintext representation of the face, with no additional characters or information. 
Please make sure that the face you generate is random, and not a fixed face.
Thank you!
